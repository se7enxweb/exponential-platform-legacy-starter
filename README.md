## What is Exponential Platform Legacy?

### The Platform v5 Dual-Kernel Architecture (Legacy Bridge)

Exponential Platform Legacy v5 runs two complementary content kernels in a single Symfony application:

- **New Stack — Exponential Platform v5 OSS (Symfony 7.4 LTS)** — the full Platform v5 content engine providing REST API v2, GraphQL, Symfony controllers, the Platform v5 Admin UI, and first-class Twig template rendering for the `site` siteaccess.
- **Legacy Kernel — via Legacy Bridge (`se7enxweb/legacy-bridge`)** — the classic eZ Publish legacy kernel running inside Symfony, served through the `legacy_site` and `legacy_admin` siteaccesses. The legacy kernel uses its own template engine (eZ Publish templates), its own routing (eZ Publish URI-based system module routing), its own admin interface, and the full library of legacy extensions you already have. It is live, fully functional, and reachable at dedicated URI-prefix siteaccesses out of the box.

The Legacy Bridge is what makes this skeleton uniquely valuable for teams running (or migrating) long-established eZ Publish-based sites: you get the full modern Symfony 7.4 LTS HTTPS stack, REST API, GraphQL, Platform v5 Admin UI, and Twig front-end — all running alongside a fully working legacy kernel with your existing legacy designs, templates, extensions, and content URLs. No legacy functionality is lost.

### Recent Improvements to Exponential Platform Legacy

Exponential Platform Legacy v5 (5.0.x) releases run the Exponential Platform v5 OSS new-stack kernel on **Symfony 7.4 LTS** with **PHP 8.3+** — while simultaneously shipping the full **Legacy Bridge by default**, making this the most capable single-project starting point available for the platform. Key improvements in recent releases include:

- Symfony 7.4 LTS new-stack kernel with Legacy Bridge on PHP 8.3+
- `QueryTranslator*` database driver family — MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and SQLite all supported in legacy kernel via a clean extension (`sevenx_exponential_platform_v5_database_translator`) installed by default
- Full multi-database support in the legacy kernel: run on MySQL 8.0, MariaDB 10.6, PostgreSQL 14+, or SQLite 3.35+ (dev/testing)
- PHP 8.3 and 8.5 full compatibility and testing across both kernels
- REST API v2, GraphQL, and JWT authentication on the Platform v5 new stack
- Dependency upgrades across Composer and Yarn package ecosystems
- Security patches and vulnerability triage

### What Does Exponential Platform Legacy Provide for End Users Building Websites?

Exponential Platform Legacy is a professional PHP application framework with advanced CMS (content management system) functionality. As a CMS, its most notable feature is its fully customizable and extendable content model. It is also suitable as a platform for general PHP development, allowing you to develop professional Internet applications, fast.

Standard CMS functionality, like news publishing and content management, is built in and ready for you to use. Its stand-alone libraries can be used for cross-platform, secure, database independent PHP projects.

Exponential Platform Legacy is database, platform and browser independent. Because it is browser based it can be used and updated from anywhere as long as you have access to the Internet.

## Legacy Bridge — Architecture & Default Siteaccess URLs

The Legacy Bridge is the centrepiece of this project. It is installed, configured, and running **by default** when you create a project from this skeleton. No post-install steps are required to activate it — the legacy kernel boots automatically for all requests to the `legacy_site` and `legacy_admin` siteaccesses.

### Dual-Kernel Architecture at a Glance

                                         Symfony controllers + Twig templates
```

The Legacy Bridge (`se7enxweb/legacy-bridge`) is the package that boots the classic eZ Publish legacy kernel inside Symfony. The legacy kernel handles all requests routed to `legacy_site` and `legacy_admin` siteaccesses using standard eZ Publish URI-based module/view routing.

### Default Legacy Siteaccess URLs

## Key CLI Commands Reference

A quick reference for the most frequently used Symfony, Platform v5, and Admin UI console commands.

> **Command Prefix Convention:** Commands using the `exponential:` prefix are canonical in this distribution. The old `ibexa:*` name works as a deprecated alias for migrated commands. The `ezplatform:*` / `ezpublish:*` prefixes do **not** exist in Platform v5. Commands not yet migrated retain their `ibexa:*` name.

### Symfony Core

```bash
php bin/console list                                          # list all registered commands
php bin/console help <command>                                # help for a specific command
php bin/console cache:clear                                   # clear application cache

### Doctrine / Migrations

```bash
php bin/console doctrine:migration:migrate --allow-no-migration   # run pending migrations
php bin/console doctrine:migration:status                          # show migration status

### Exponential Platform v5 (new stack)

> **Command Prefix Convention:** `exponential:*` is canonical. `ibexa:*` is a deprecated alias for migrated commands. The `ezplatform:*` prefix does **not** exist in Platform v5.

```bash
php bin/console exponential:install exponential-oss           # fresh install with demo data
php bin/console exponential:reindex                           # rebuild search index (full)
php bin/console exponential:reindex --iteration-count=50      # incremental reindex
php bin/console ibexa:cron:run                                # run the Platform v5 cron scheduler
php bin/console ibexa:graphql:generate-schema                 # regenerate GraphQL schema from content model
# Solr: no console command in v5 — provision cores via Solr Admin HTTP API
php bin/console bazinga:js-translation:dump public/assets --merge-domains   # JS i18n
php bin/console fos:httpcache:invalidate:path / --all         # purge HTTP cache paths
php bin/console lexik:jwt:generate-keypair                    # generate RSA keypair for REST API auth
```

php bin/console ezpublish:legacy:assets_install --symlink --relative public

# Install legacy extension symlinks from all registered bundles
php bin/console ezpublish:legacybundles:install_extensions --relative

# Regenerate legacy autoloads (required after adding/removing extensions or classes)
php bin/console ezpublish:legacy:script bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php

# Run the legacy content crawler / maintenance script
php bin/console ezpublish:legacy:script bin/php/ezmaintenance.php

# Check legacy kernel status
php bin/console ezpublish:legacy:script bin/php/ezsiteinstaller.php

# Run any legacy PHP script through the bridge kernel
php bin/console ezpublish:legacy:script <path/to/script.php> [-- [legacy-args]]

# Dump legacy INI settings as resolved through the siteaccess config resolver
php bin/console exponential:debug:config-resolver languages --siteaccess=legacy_site
php bin/console exponential:debug:config-resolver languages --siteaccess=legacy_admin

### Frontend / Asset Build (Yarn / Webpack Encore)

Activate Node.js 20 LTS via nvm before running any Yarn commands:

```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use 20    # activate Node.js 20 LTS (required)
corepack enable                        # activates Yarn 1.22.22 as declared in package.json

yarn install            # install / update Node dependencies
yarn dev                # build all assets with source maps — dev mode
yarn build              # build all assets minified for production
yarn watch              # watch mode — auto-rebuild site assets on change
yarn ibexa:dev          # build Platform v5 Admin UI assets — dev mode
yarn ibexa:watch        # watch mode — auto-rebuild Admin UI assets on change
yarn ibexa:build        # build Platform v5 Admin UI assets — production
```

All `ibexa:*` scripts build through `webpack.config.js` using `--config-name ibexa`, which applies the required `@ibexa-admin-ui` alias and configuration.

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for the complete step-by-step guide with server configuration, Solr, Varnish, and production deployment.
